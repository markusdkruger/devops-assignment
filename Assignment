Prepare manifests for two different kubernetes environments test and prod
These manifests will be rolled out on the same cluster and the same namespace
Use Kustomize to generate manifests - They should share as much as possible and rely on patches for environment specific configurations
The manifests must have the following labels set: 
    env must have values 'test' or 'prod'. 
    app must have value helloworld
Service is based on a python application that exposes a HTTP GET endpoint, with the response returning content of message stored in ConfigMap
The service must be accessible from outside the cluster via an Istio Gateway


Mention any points that will require to be adjusted in different contexts (workstation vs other cluster)
Design a controller that watches above ConfigMap and do a rolling restart of the service in case of change:
